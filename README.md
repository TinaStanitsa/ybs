-I believe I have completed the brief to its fullest.
-Landing on the first page, we see images from Yorkshire. Every post has the user's image, username, title of post, image in the middle and tags. We can also see how recent the picture was (Today, 1d, 2d etc)
-Clicking on a card, we are transfered to another screen that shows more info about the photo and the user.

-Clicking on the user's photo or details from first fragment or second, transfers us to another screen that show's the user's posts. From this screen, we can only go back, no click functionality was done.
 -This is something that could be done for next iteration.
-Also, another thing that could be improved upon would be the requests, with paging.

-For the additional features I ran short of time for adding search but added state handling with animations and error messages.
-The app requires only the api key given by flickr and runs with safe search enabled.

-Utilises the Retrofit API.
